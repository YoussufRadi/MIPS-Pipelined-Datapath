# MIPS-Pipelined-Datapath
The goal of this project is to implement a low-level cycle-accurate pipelined MIPS datapath simulator. Simulating the datapath includes simulating all of its storage components (register file, memories, and pipeline registers) and all of its control signals. This document details the supported instructions, the inputs to the simulator, and the expected outputs.
